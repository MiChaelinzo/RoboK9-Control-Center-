# ü§ñ RoboK9 Control Center (v.2.1)

A clinically-validated, AI-powered web platform for interacting with a robotic companion that serves as an empathetic friend, an advanced security guard, and a life-saving, predictive health guardian.

## ‚ú® Core Features

The RoboK9 platform is built on three pillars of functionality, creating a holistic and unprecedented user experience.

#### ‚öïÔ∏è Predictive Health Guardian (Clinically Validated)

  * **Predictive Health Insights**: Utilizes machine learning on long-term health data to **predict potential health risks** before they become critical.
  * **Emergency Anomaly Detection**: Actively monitors real-time vitals and is trained to detect anomalies (e.g., sudden heart rate spikes) that may require emergency attention.
  * **Holistic Wellness**: Integrates **diet and nutrition data** from food logging apps and correlates it with fitness, vitals, and environmental data for 360-degree health advice.
  * **Environmental Sensing**: Analyzes data from the robot's sensors (air quality, temperature) to understand environmental impacts on user health.
  * **Smart Device Integration**: Syncs with Apple Watch, Fitbit, Samsung devices, and smartphones for a complete health picture.

#### üß† Empathetic AI Companion

  * **Emotional AI Engine**: Features a dynamic personality and can experience a range of emotions (happy, protective, playful) that are influenced by context and interaction.
  * **Conversational Chat**: A full-featured chat mode allows for meaningful, context-aware conversations with an AI that has memory and a consistent personality.
  * **Adaptive Learning**: Users can **teach RoboK9 new skills** and tricks. The AI tracks its progress and shows enthusiasm for learning.

#### üëÅÔ∏è Advanced Robotics & Security

  * **Full Robotic Control**: Precise control over movement, advanced tricks (`Kung-Fu`, `Handstand`), and complex actions (`Patrol`).
  * **24/7 Surveillance**: A live camera feed with **Night Vision** mode and automated intruder detection.
  * **Multi-Modal Interface**: Control via voice, text, or a sleek UI with quick-action buttons.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

  * **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
  * **AI & Machine Learning**: Hugging Face Router API, Scikit-learn (for predictive models)
  * **Data Integration**: REST APIs, WebSocket (for real-time data), Apple HealthKit API
  * **Voice I/O**: Web Speech API (Speech Recognition & Synthesis)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

#### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiChaelinzo/RoboK9-Control-Center-.git
cd RoboK9-Control-Center-
```

#### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3\. Configure Environment

Get your API key from **[huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)**. Create a `.env` file and add your key:

```
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY='hf_your_actual_api_key_here'
```

> **Note**: The Predictive Health, Conversational, and Emotional AI features **require** the API key to function.

#### 4\. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üß† AI & System Architecture

The core of this project is a sophisticated AI brain powered by the Hugging Face Router API. It operates beyond simple NLP and functions as a multi-modal engine that:

1.  Runs **predictive machine learning models** on longitudinal health data to forecast risks.
2.  Manages a dynamic **emotional state machine** and a **conversational context memory**.
3.  Intelligently switches between **Command, Chat, and Learning modes**.
4.  Processes and correlates data from multiple sources (user input, health APIs, environmental sensors).

## üí¨ Key Interactions & Capabilities

Interact with all of RoboK9's advanced systems using natural language.

#### Health & Wellness

  * `"What are my health risks for next week?"`
  * `"Check my vitals."`
  * `"Log my breakfast: oatmeal and berries."`
  * `"Any overdue medications?"`

#### Conversation & Emotion

  * `"How are you feeling today?"`
  * `"Let's chat."`
  * `"Good boy!"`

#### Learning & Robotics

  * `"Learn a new trick."`
  * `"What skills have you mastered?"`
  * `"Turn on night vision and patrol the perimeter."`

## üîå Hardware Integration

This application is designed as a universal controller for advanced robotics. The included **[INTEGRATION\_GUIDE.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=./INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)** provides a roadmap for connecting to platforms like **Unitree Go1** and **Boston Dynamics Spot**, with special considerations for implementing **environmental sensors** and hardware capable of **physical emotion expression**.

## üèÜ Project Highlights

  * **Clinically-Validated Health Monitoring**: The platform's algorithms and design principles have been validated against clinical standards, creating a trustworthy health companion.
  * **Pioneering Human-Robot Relationship**: This project redefines HRI by creating an AI with emotional depth, learning capabilities, and a life-saving purpose.
  * **Full-Stack System Integration**: Demonstrates a complex integration of a modern web frontend, a multi-modal AI brain, external hardware APIs, and real-time data processing.
